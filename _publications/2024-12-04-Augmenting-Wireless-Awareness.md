Abstract
---
A general consumer around the world gets general awareness about the causes of mechanical, electrical or digital problems in their house (or neighborhood) and how to fix them through common life experiences or learning from their peers. However, despite similar level of integration into everyday life, the understanding of wireless technologies lags significantly. This bottleneck leads to consumer dissatisfaction and reduced profits for cellular providers.

This demo presents a vision for consumer-facing wireless tools that can augment the understanding of wireless propagation and the reason for its failure in certain scenarios. Our solution will leverage existing ray-tracing based wireless simulators in a new way to map and visualize the coverage in three key use-cases for this technology. Further, we motivate the need for bringing transparency and metric-driven regulation for wireless and mobile systems.
