Abstract
---
The fundamental bottleneck in adapting data-driven wireless solutions to real world is the lack of tools for augmenting good quality data which is environment-specific. Indeed, much of the data required for popular data-driven wireless communication and sensing systems requires domain expertise beyond the reach of an average consumer. This demo presents a radical new vision for generating synthetic data in consumer-specific environments by leveraging the power of modern compute.

This demo presents a vision for consumer-facing wireless tools that can augment synthetic data for development and adaptation of data-driven wireless systems. Our solution leverages existing ray-tracing based wireless simulators in a new way to map and visualize the coverage in three key use-cases for this technology. Further, we motivate the need for development of such tools for generating synthetic data is vital towards a broader vision of foundational wireless models for data-driven wireless communication and sensing systems.
